                The Mobile Artifical Intelligence Distribution (MAID) project is a research initiative 
                focused on the development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) systems on 
                mobile devices. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of MAID is to create a frontend for AI that is private, secure, 
                and efficient, allowing users to leverage the power of AI without compromising their
                personal data or privacy.
